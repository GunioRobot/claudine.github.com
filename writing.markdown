A Mac geek's approach to writing in the humanities
==================================================

Much of my writing nowadays is for my theology studies at the [United
Faculty of Theology](http://www.uft.edu.au/), which uses an
idiosyncratic style based on [Turabian](http://www.press.uchicago.edu/books/turabian/turabian_citationguide.html)
(one of the preferred citation styles in the humanities). I've mainly
used LaTeX for typesetting academic documents since my undergraduate
history days (I have never been very representative of historans or of
geeks).  My current writing workflow follows.

Drafting in Scrivener
---------------------

I prepare my drafts in
[Scrivener](http://www.literatureandlatte.com/scrivener.html) -- yes,
it's Mac-only and non-free, but I haven't found an editor or writing
tool that better matches my analogue research and writing methods,
especially my use of [index
cards](http://www.flickr.com/photos/claudine/1871068148/). Scrivener
allows me to move sections or discrete parts of sections between the
draft and research containers. A paper in the humanities can go through
many iterations as one explores and analyses new sources, and Scrivener
allows me to keep research notes and discarded draft sections in the
same package as what will become the final draft, without cluttering it.

Scrivener can export individual 'cards' to text files, but the most
preferred method of publishing is to compile the draft (all of it, or
selected cards) into one document. Scrivener can compile the draft
directly into RTF, Word or OpenDocument, or into LaTeX, HTML or RTF via
MultiMarkdown.

MultiMarkdown to LaTeX
----------------------

[MultiMarkdown](http://fletcherpenney.net/multimarkdown/) is an
extension of [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/)
that extends the syntax of Markdown and can generate LaTeX and RTF as
well as HTML.
