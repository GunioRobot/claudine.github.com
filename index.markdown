[__Founders and Survivors__](http://foundersandsurvivors.org/) aims to document the lives of convicts transported to Van Diemen's Land, and their families. The public website, built with Drupal, provides an interface to archival transcriptions and a means of collecting genealogical data submitted by family historians.

[__Friends of Same__](http://friendsofsame.org/) is a
partnership between the town of Same, Manufahi, Timor-Leste and the
City of Boroondara, Victoria, Australia. The current version of this site is built with Perl Template Toolkit but I am in the process of migrating it to Drupal.
