title: DrupalSouth 2010 debrief, phase one
---

[DrupalSouth](http://wellington2010.drupalsouth.net.nz/) has ended and I am on the ferry to the South Island of New Zealand. As at LCA, my DrupalSouth [presentation](http://wellington2010.drupalsouth.net.nz/session/using-drupal-for-collaborative-historical-research) was scheduled relatively early in the programme which meant that I was able to enjoy most of the event without speaker anxiety. While my LCA presentation was an introduction to humanities computing through the example of [Founders and Survivors](http://www.foundersandsurvivors.org/), the DrupalSouth one was a case study of how and why I used Drupal for F&S and some of the challenges that I had encountered.

[Drupal](http://drupal.org/) is a content management framework used to build websites ranging from small individual sites to some of the [largest in the world](http://drupal.org/cases). Like Linux and the kind of project that gets featured at linux.conf.au, Drupal is [open source software](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software) and is motivated by the same principles of grassroots software development and community support. DrupalSouth piggybacked on linux.conf.au so that some of the international superstars of Drupal development could attend both events.
