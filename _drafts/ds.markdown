title: DrupalSouth 2010 debrief, phase one
---

[DrupalSouth](http://wellington2010.drupalsouth.net.nz/) is still under way but I am taking a break from presentations as my head is already full after a week of linux.conf.au and Drupal. As at lca, [my presentation](http://wellington2010.drupalsouth.net.nz/session/using-drupal-for-collaborative-historical-research) was scheduled relatively early in the programme which meant that I was able to enjoy most of the event without speaker anxiety. While my lca presentation was an introduction to humanities computing through the example of [Founders and Survivors](http://www.foundersandsurvivors.org/), the DrupalSouth one was a case study of how and why I used Drupal for F&S and some of the challenges that I had encountered.

[Drupal](http://drupal.org/) is a content management framework used to build websites ranging from small individual sites to some of the [largest in the world](http://drupal.org/cases). Like Linux and the kind of project that gets featured at linux.conf.au, Drupal is [open source software](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software)... smaller, more focused than lca...

DrupalSouth took advantage of the timing and location linux.conf.au and the programme featured some of the international superstars of Drupal development.
