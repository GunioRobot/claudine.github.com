title: My software toolkit
---

I'm starting to acquire and move between a few different computers, so here I am going to keep track of the the software that I like to have everywhere. No, I am no longer a free-software purist. I'm now surrounded by Mac users and it has become too easy to join the Mac fan club.

# Mac

## Utilities

* [1Password](http://agilewebsolutions.com/products/1Password) password manager
* [Dropbox](http://www.dropbox.com/) file synchronisation (Mac, Linux and Windows)
* [Things](http://culturedcode.com/things/) todo list manager to keep the guilt levels high

## Development

* [Cyberduck](http://cyberduck.ch/) (S)FTP client
* [Git](http://git-scm.com/) version control -- [OS X installer](http://code.google.com/p/git-osx-installer/)
* [MacVim](http://code.google.com/p/macvim/) the editor
* [TextWrangler](http://www.barebones.com/products/textwrangler/) another editor (Mac-only)
* [Aquamacs](http://aquamacs.org/) for when I am nostalgic for Emacs

## Writing/office

* [Bean](http://www.bean-osx.com/Bean.html) a small, fast word processor
* [NeoOffice](http://www.neooffice.org/) clone of OpenOffice.org for the Mac
* [Scrivener](http://www.literatureandlatte.com/scrivener.html) for organising writing and research

## Web browsers

* [Camino](http://caminobrowser.org/) a small, fast web browser, less likely to crash than the other two
* [Firefox](http://www.mozilla.com/firefox/) I tend to overload this with extensions then wonder why it's running slowly or crashing
* [Safari](http://www.apple.com/safari/) is part of OS X

## Communication

* Apple Mail is part of OS X and can access my work email on Exchange
* [Adium](http://www.adium.im/) instant messaging client
* [Colloquy](http://colloquy.info/) IRC client
