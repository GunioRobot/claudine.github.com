title: About
---

I am a research assistant at the University of Melbourne, working on a number of historical projects including [Founders and Survivors: Australian Lifecourses in Historical Context](http://www.foundersandsurvivors.org/).

Although I now work mostly with Macs, I support the movements to promote free and open source software, and open access content.  I am a member of [AussieChix](http://au.linuxchix.org/), the Australian chapter of [LinuxChix](http://www.linuxchix.org/).

I am Anglican, and in my 'other life' I study theology at the [United Faculty of Theology](http://www.uft.edu.au/) and [Trinity College](http://www.trinity.unimelb.edu.au/theological_school).
