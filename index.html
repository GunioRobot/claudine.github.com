<p>Although I now work mostly with Macs, I support the movements to
promote free and open source software, and open access content.  I am
a member of <a href="http://au.linuxchix.org/">AussieChix</a>, the
Australian chapter of <a
href="http://www.linuxchix.org/">LinuxChix</a>.</p>

<p>I am Anglican, and in my 'other life' I study theology at the
    <a href="http://www.uft.unimelb.edu.au/">United Faculty of
    Theology</a> and <a
    href="http://www.trinity.unimelb.edu.au/theological_school">Trinity
    College</a>.  I was a member of the congregation of <a
    href="http://www.stpaulscathedral.org.au/">St Paul's Cathedral,
    Melbourne</a> for seven years, but am now on a student
    placement at the parish of St John's, East Malvern.</a></p>

<p>I would love to hear from anyone who can tell me more about <a
href="famhist.html">my surname or family history</a>.</p>

<p>I am not currently looking for work, but my <a
href="claudine_chionh.pdf">CV</a> (PDF) is online.</p>

<p> I keep an occasional blog on <a
    href="http://claudine-c.livejournal.com">Livejournal</a> and can
