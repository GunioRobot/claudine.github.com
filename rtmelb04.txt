I don't think I can outdo Sarah's efforts describing our encounters with
RT. (Only two encounters for me, as I did not get to the Basement Discs
appearance. Shame on me for not supporting my local record store,
as RT said during the show (not referring to me in particular).)

I was obsessive enough to write down a set list, so here, for your
enjoyment (it seems to have varied from some of the other Aust. shows):

* Word unspoken
* King of Bohemia
* Cooksferry Queen (this one really rocked!)
* Outside of the inside
* Alexander Graham Bell ('this goes very fast, please pay attention')
* One door opens
* A love you can't survive
* Crawl back (as Sarah noted, the audience response was pathetic)

     'I used to be in a band...'
* Sloth ('the abridged version, only 45 minutes')
* VBL 1952

     'Let's skip over the Black Death ... songs like "it's my pustule and
     I'll cry if I want to"'
* So Ben Mi Ca Bon Tempo
* Shenandoah
* Oops I did it again
* Persuasion
* For shame of doing wrong
* Cold kisses
* Watch me go
* I want to see the bright lights tonight

Encore 1:
* Gethsemane
* I feel so good

Encore 2:
* Wall of death
* Beeswing

Then followed the exclusive meetup. I don't think I've ever participated
in one of these before, certainly not with a performer I actually like.
I am a shy person in real life and was afraid of saying/doing anything
embarrassing or incriminating, so I ended up not saying much. No pork
pie bloopers here! ;-)

Was this about 'Streets of Paradise'? I didn't say anything because I
don't have the faintest idea what this is about.

Sarah didn't mention the discussion (with Adrian and Brian) about
soccer... it appears that RT's ?favourite team is Celtic.

It was a delightful experience, and many thanks to Sarah for picking up
the ball I'd dropped and arranging things with Simon and the Beekeeper
(whose identity remains a mystery) and convincing the SPUD to bring his
camera.
