<h1 class="title">Using mailing lists</h1>
There is very little privacy on the internet. Even on a closed,
moderated list, your words are only as secure as the least secure link
in the chain of computers that transport them.  Anything you send in
email can be quoted, misattributed, taken out of context and used
against you.  <i>NEVER</i> send private or confidential
material or contact details to a mailing list. When sending such
material through private email, consider securing it with
cryptographic software such as <a href="http://www.gnupg.org/">GNU Privacy Guard</a>.

<p>
Please familiarise yourself with the list's methods of managing your
subscription. Mailing lists are operated by computer software. Some
mailing lists require that you unsubscribe by sending commands (in the
software's limited vocabulary) by email, while others offer a
web-based interface for these commands. (<i>Yahoo!  Groups</i> offers
both.) When subscribing, you should have received a "welcome letter"
explaining how to unsubscribe or change other subscription
settings. Do not post to the list address asking to be unsubscribed,
as the other subscribers cannot do this for you. When interacting with
the list software, be sure to use the same address that you are
subscribed with, or the software may not recognise you. As a last
resort, you can ask the list's moderator or administrator for help,
but it is generally better to let the machines do the housework!
</p>
<p>
If forwarding someone else's reporting or opinions, please name the
sources. Do not spread chains of anonymous rumours. Be mindful that
many media sources and well-known individuals enforce strict copyright
terms on their creations. If you are forward copyright material
without permission, be prepared for the consequences.
</p>
<p>
Be extremely wary when cross-posting to more than one mailing list or
to a combination of lists and individuals, or when replying to
cross-posts. Recipients may accidentally reply to all addresses found
in the headers. In most cases this is not appropriate. You should
never expose other people's private email addresses, and this is
especially dangerous and intrusive when posting addresses to mailing
lists. You can hide people's addresses using the "Bcc:" ("Blind Carbon
Copy") header available in most email clients, or by sending the
material in a separate email to each recipient.
</p>
<p>
Do not make assumptions about others based on their address,
affiliation, software or written language skills. While English is the
dominant language on the internet, not everybody speaks it as their
first language.
</p>
<p>
Time, disk space and bandwidth (the amount of data that can be
transported through a network at a given time) are finite and usually
cost the users money. Do not use HTML or proprietary word-processing
formats where plain text will do. These add unnecessary bloat to the
size of a message and, if they do not follow commonly accepted
standards, may not be readable by other people.
</p>
<p>
To give concrete examples, a 200 word piece of text takes up between 1
and 2 kilobytes. The equivalent in HTML (where formatting tags are
added) could be between twice and four times as large. This all adds
up! Even if your email software can read HTML, it will take longer to
parse formatted text than plain.  Word processors are worse as there
is no official standard for the format of a word-processing file. A
word-processed document may need to be converted to text (taking extra
time) or may be completely inaccessible on a recipient's computer. You
cannot assume that everyone on a mailing list uses the exact same
hardware and software configuration that you do.
</p>
<p>
<a href="http://expita.com/nomime.html"">No MIME</a> provides a thorough explanation of why HTML email is a bad
idea, and instructions for configuring most popular email clients to
send email as text.
</p>
<p>
If you wish to publish something other than text to a large group of
people, do not send it to a mailing list. This would generate a copy
of the attachment for each and every subscriber to the list, causing
bottlenecks and delays in all of the networks between the sender and
each recipient. Rather, make the file available from a public FTP
server or Web site. If you don't have access to either of these, you
may be able to find someone who is willing to share their web space
with you.  (<i>Yahoo! Groups</i> and other web-based mailing lists provide
groups with shared space for this purpose.)
</p>
<p>
Do not reply to a message in public if the reply should be private.
Such situations include "in-jokes" or references to old school
friends, references that are meaningless to 99% of the subscribers. It
is also generally advisable not to reply to the list if the sole
content of the reply is "I agree!" or similar.
</p>
<p>
Pay attention to the headers of the message to which you are
replying. Some mailing list programs interfere with messages to add a
"Reply-To:" which causes replies to be sent to the list by
default. (<i>Yahoo! Groups</i> does this.) If you are sending a private
reply, you will probably have to delete the list address and replace
it with the recipient's private email address. (Check the "From:"
header.) On the other hand, some other mailing list packages do not
add a "Reply-To:" header, meaning that replies go to the original
poster by default. This sometimes causes replies to go private when
they would have been more appropriate on the list, but this situation
is generally not as embarrassing as the opposite.
</p>
<p>
<i>Quoting previous messages</i>: When replying, quote only the material to
which you are directly responding and delete the rest -- we have the
original copies, thank you! (If someone has lost their copy of the
original post, they can check the list archive or ask the original
poster for a copy.)  Attribute to the person or people to whom you are
responding.  Use the standard "&gt; " ("greater-than") symbol followed by
a space to indicate quotes.  All email clients recognise this
convention, but some, such as Outlook Express and AOL, require the
poster to change their default settings in order to post properly.
</p>
<p>
Always add a meaningful "Subject:" header to your message. If you are
replying to a message received in digest form, please replace "Digest
number xxx" with the original poster's subject text or something
similar.   If the content of the thread has drifted, give it a more
appropriate subject, indicating the original. For example:
"Subject: Cheese, was Re: bishops".
</p>
<p>
When starting a new thread, compose a new email "To:" the list
address. Do not "Reply" to a message that has no relation to your
thread!  Some mail clients make use of the "References:" and
"In-Reply-To:" headers that are added by replies, and get confused by
this behaviour.
