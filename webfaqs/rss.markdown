title: What is an RSS feed?
---

On some websites you may see an icon that looks like ![feed icon](/images/feed-icon-14x14.png) in your browser's address bar or on the site itself. This icon indicates that the website publishes one or more RSS or Atom feeds. RSS stands for Really Simple Syndication, and is an alternative way of keeping track of websites that are updated frequently. If you have many favourite websites that change frequently (e.g. news sites or blogs), you can subscribe to them in a feed reader so that you can see all the updates in one place, rather than having to visit each site separately.

A feed reader can be a separate computer program or a web application. One popular web-based feed reader is [Google Reader](http://reader.google.com/). A list of both web- and desktop-based feed readers can be found on [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_feed_aggregators). Whichever reader you use, you can add as many RSS or Atom feeds as you like, and keep up-to-date with your favourite websites without having to visit each one individually.
